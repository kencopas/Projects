The current implementation of the neural network appears to have some discrepancies between the expected outputs and the predicted outputs, indicating areas where the model's performance could be improved. The stdout shows an average error of 3.88%, which may not be satisfactory depending on the precision requirements of the model.

To improve the situation, I'll outline the changes and improvements needed to fix observed inaccuracies and inefficiencies:

1. **Module Import Paths:**
   - The import statements for `Layer` and `image_generator` in `network.py` inside "Snapshot" directory need to be updated to use the correct casing to conform with Python's naming conventions. Ensure that modules are imported with lowercase names, matching the filenames.

2. **Layer class improvement:**
   - Address potential weight initialization inconsistencies. It is common practice to use more robust initialization methods like He initialization or Xavier initialization instead of uniform initialization, which could improve model training stability.

3. **Learning Rate:**
   - The learning rate of 10 used in the `my_network.train()` call inside the "Snapshot" `network.py` is uncommonly high. Consider experimenting with smaller learning rates to find a balance that reduces the error more effectively without overshooting during training.

4. **Activation Function:**
   - The sigmoid function is used for all layers, which might not be ideal for the hidden layers. Consider using ReLU activation for hidden layers, which might provide better performance, especially in deeper networks.

5. **Backpropagation Logic:**
   - Ensure consistency in the backpropagation function, mainly in how errors and gradients are propagated back. Verify that the handling of input-to-layer and layer-to-layer error propagation maintains consistent logic through deltas' calculation and application.

6. **File Structure Consistency:**
   - The "Snapshot" directory seems to contain old or backup versions of the files. Ensure consistency by either consolidating old files or updating all to reflect the same improvements and corrections.

Here’s a brief explanation of the changes you will make to the files:

### network.py in "Snapshot" Directory
```python
from layer import Layer  # Change Layer to lowercase
from image_generator import gen_set

# Replace the `Layer` import from `Layer` to `layer`
# Replace image_generator import accordingly
# etc.

class Network:
    # All logic stays mostly the same; focus on adjusting learning rate and activation functions
    # Additional changes to the activation functions can be handled within the Layer class
```

### layer.py
Update the activation function and consider adding parameterized initialization, or move to a more suitable activation function like ReLU for hidden layers.

```python
def relu(x):
    return max(0, x)

def relu_derivative(x):
    return 1 if x > 0 else 0

class Layer:
    # Use ReLU for hidden layers, sigmoid for output layer if classification
    # Adjust weight initialization using He or Xavier methods dependent on activation
```

### Further Exploration
You might also consider implementing learning rate schedules, batch normalization, or regularization techniques depending on complexity and resources. Gradually build complexity in each enhancement addressing core issues.

Please implement these changes incrementally and monitor the output and error ratio to determine the effectiveness of each modification.
